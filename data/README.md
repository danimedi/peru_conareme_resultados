The data sets were created with a "tidy data" approach. Each row representing an observation for an individual in a given year, and each column representing a variable.

`data_set_deidentified.csv` contains the final data but without the columns containing sensible information that could be used to identify the individuals.

`data_set.csv`contains the final data with all the information but this is not publicly available.

The variables (columns) available are:

- `year`: year.
- `Nombres`: first names
- `Apellido Paterno`: last name from father
- `Apellido Materno`: last name from mother
- `Especialidad/SubEspecialidad_postulantes` and `Especialidad/SubEspecialidad_ingresantes`: specialty/subspecialty during application and that in which the person got in, respectively
- `Universidad_postulantes` and `Universidad_ingresantes`: university
